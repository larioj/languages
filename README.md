# Languages

## C
I have most experience with C. In my opinion it is a very nice language.
It is simple and powerful. My only beef with it is that it has no
real support for generics. You can do pseudo-template stuff with the preprocessor
but it gets bloated quickly. Also no overloading so function names
tend to be less than obvious. The biggest advantage of C is that it doesn't
hide too many things from you. The name of the game is performance and control.

The thing that I like best about C is that it is not a general purpose
language, or at least it doesn't attempt to do everything and fall
miserably short of its goal.

### When do I use it?
Building operating systems, and small programs/algorithms where performance
is critical.

### When not to use it?
Input! Taking input in C is difficult if done correctly.

## C++
Despite its name, I don't think C++ is very much like C. It inherits a lot of
the syntax, but so do Java and other languages. The memory management model
seems powerful, but pays for it by increasing complexity. Actually,
an appropriate generalization of C++ is that it pays for everything with
increases in complexity. Because of this it isn't very suitable for well
structured small to medium sized projects.

My biggest issue with C++ is that it's a mammoth. It has accumulated a lot of
elements throughout the years, and its difficult to know what does what, or
what exactly each construct costs. It is also difficult to learn, and dealing
with templates is less than friendly. The documentation is cryptic.

### When do I use it?
When I need C performance but I'd like the object abstraction. Basically
big, performance-critical programs.

### When not to use it?
When there is something simpler that will get the job done.

## Java
## Opinion
Not bad. 

## When to use it?
