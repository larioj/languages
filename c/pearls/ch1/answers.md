## Problem 1
Do a two pass algorithm that sorts the first 16000 numbers
and then the remaining. The run time of the algorithm would
be twice the previous run time.

## Problem 2
We could implement bit vectors by using an array of integers,
and using the bitwise operations to index within the integers.
If we weren't given bitwise operations, we'd have to implement
them using the mathematical primitives.

	shift_left(word, n): word * 2**n ?
	shift_right(word, n): word / 2**n ?
	and(lhs, rhs):

## Problem 3
